  A breathtaking desert dweller that is both beautiful and powerful. Datura is a perennial that dies back in the winter and can grow five feet in a single growing season.

  Perfectly at home in rocky, sandy soils they should not need any supplemental watering or nutrients. A great option for those that have hot open spaces with deer, rabbits, and other hungry herbivores. Re-seeding liberally, they can take over a small garden.

  USE CAUTION AROUND DATURA. They are poisonous and should be treated with respect. Always wash your hands well after handling. If you decide to save the seeds, make sure to clearly label and store safely. I wouldn’t recommend Datura to someone with young children or pets and an enclosed yard.
